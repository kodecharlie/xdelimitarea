What is xdelimitarea?
*********************

   `xdelimitarea' is an X Windows utility that provides a non-intrusive
way to find out the position (with respect to the root window) and the
dimensions of an arbitrary rectangular area on your computer screen.
This utility could be helpful to, say, GUI or web designers who need to
know precisely the location and dimensions of some visual component on
the screen.

Origins
*******

   Tom Tromey first suggested this idea to me in 1993 when I was
developing the rendering code for a data-analysis package called the
SigniScope.  Other ideas in `xdelimitarea' (as well as some code) are
borrowed from Jamie Zawinski's `xscreensaver' program.

   This package was developed under Redhat 7.3 in the country of
Uganda.  Thanks to AED <http://www.aed.org> for donating the computer
equipment and the Internet hook-up where I work.

How it works
************

   After you have installed the package, just type `xdelimitarea' from
your command-line.  Visually, nothing of interest happens.  Crucially,
however, `xdelimitarea' has grabbed your keyboard, and the only
graceful way to exit now is to either type 'q', 'Q', or 'Control-c', if
that is what you want to do.

   To delimit some area on the screen, just click Button1 on your mouse
and drag.  You should see a small window pop up that reads out the
location (with respect to the root window) and the dimensions of the
area you have outlined.  That's all there is to it!

Command-line options
********************

   The possible command-line options for `xdelimitarea' are:

   * `-help' is used to find out what command-line options are possible.

   * `-fg' is used to specify the color of the text drawn in the
     readout window as you delimit some region on your computer screen.

   * `-bg' is used to specify the background color of the readout
     window.

   * `-font' is used to specify the name of the font used to render
     text in the readout window.


   With the exception of `-help', all command-line options can
alternatively be specified as X Windows resources in, for example, your
`.Xdefaults' file.  *Note X Resources::, for details.

X Resources
***********

   The readout window for `xdelimitarea' can be configured with X
Windows resources by, for example, adding suitable lines to your
`.Xdefaults' file.

   * Specify the default background for the readout window by adding a
     line like this:

            xdelimitarea.*.background:         green


   * Specify the default foreground for the readout window by adding a
     line like this:

            xdelimitarea.*.foreground:         red


   * Specify the default font for the readout window by adding a line
     like this:

            xdelimitarea.*.font:         -adobe-helvetica-bold-*-normal-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
